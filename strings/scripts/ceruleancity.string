Hey! You!\nYou're a Pok\emon Trainer, right?\lCould I ask for a favor[.]?\pThat bridge ahead is [GREEN]Nugget Bridge[BLACK].\pYou have to beat five Pok\emon\nTrainers to get across.\pBut[.] I don't have any Pok\emon!\pI'm trying to go meet this guy\nnamed Bill who lives up that way[.]\pBut if I don't have any Pok\emon,\nI have to do the fighting myself!\pI don't really want to punch any\nmore Pok\emon[.]\pSo, can you clear the way for me?\nI don't have any rewards to offer[.]\l[.]but[.]\lI heard there's a prize if you win.
