Every few years, we accept a new\nregion's Pok\emon into the Pok\edex.\pThere's countless Pok\emon, so we\nneed regions' professors to meet\nspecific documentation criteria.\pI used to work at Oak's, you know.\nThere was one year[.]\pIt was when [GREEN]Unova[BLACK]'s Pok\emon were\nadded to the [BLUE]National Pok\edex[BLACK].\pWe got a really blurry screenshot\nfrom Professor Juniper's team,\lof a Pok\emon we didn't know.\pWe were really crunching to get\nthe Pok\edex ready in time.\pIn the heat of the moment, someone\ndrew over the blurry photo[.]\l[.]and just[.]\l[.]made their own Pok\emon out of it.\pIt was some kind of duck with an\nacorn lodged in its head?\pWe got a better photo a few hours\nlater.\pThe Pok\emon in question was\nOshawott[.]\lNeither a duck, nor acorn.\lSomeone did get fired for that.
