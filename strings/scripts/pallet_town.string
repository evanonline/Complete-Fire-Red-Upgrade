Don't flatter yourself, petty\nnonacademic. I've seen you cite\lThe Mushroom Kingdom.\pThat site is many things, but\nI assure you that a reliable source\lisn't one of them.\pYou think you're the greatest\nsource for free information\lin the modern world?\pYou're not!\pYour site's existence is dependent on\nthe gullibility of modern society\lwho'll believe whatever you preach.\pYour site is for lazy people,\npeople too lazy to do their homework\land use your pathetic waste\lof a site as a crutch\lfor easy information full\lof factual flaws that anyone\lcan bend and twist at any time.\pThe amount of contempt I have for you\nwould blow your mind if you\lcould see it on my face.\pYou think you're the hero in\nthis story?\pYou're not.\pYou have done more harm than good\nto the way people do their research.
